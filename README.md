# azure-mobile-apps-compatibility

This module allows you to generate a set of scaffolded table and custom API
definitions from the set of definition files from an Azure Mobile Service.

The generated app is ready to deploy to an Azure Mobile App and should work
for most simple cases. More complex cases, particularly involving authentication,
will likely require some code changes.

#### This module is currently in an experimental status.

More information to come soon.
